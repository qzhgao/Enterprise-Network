# Invite

Dear colleagues @ IETF119

We want to invite you for a  public side meeting to hear from Enterprises and SP Enterprise Services participants about enterprise networking specific scenarios and deployment problems that you are interested in to find more interest in the IETF or would like to question other participants about -band you have not found a fitting WG/RG to do the work in, or would ike to reach out to a broader enterprisebcommunity.

We thought this might be of interest to brainstorm topics before they may be ripe for a WG, and also because existing WGs may either by alreadying having more than full agendas with broader scope or do not cover (all of) the desired enterprise scope (eg: opsawg, iotdir, mops).

This meeting is scheduled for Thursday March 21st in P6-7, 8:00 - 9:30 AM and is listed in the IETF119 side
meeting wiki:

   https://wiki.ietf.org/en/meeting/119/sidemeetings

We will also use the side meeting webex, so you can attend remotely, or if the room is too crowded:

   https://ietf.webex.com/meet/ietfsidemeeting2

If we see that there is interest in this type of non-WG sync-up, maybe it could also lead to an "enterprise" mailing list to allow for such a forum to continue.

Let us know if you have specific topics you would like to talk about < 10 minutes, so we can set aside
some time, but we would like to keep at least 30 minutes of the meeting for open discussions.

# Recording

Unfortunately, the recording did not quite work out. The side meeting explanations recommended to record on the organizers local laptop, which i did, and. in result i got a short .mp4 file and a 250MByte .webex file, both of which i fail to play fully as expected.

Turns out that the .webex file is actually an mp4 file which you can play when you rename it to .mp4 with various players, but it has multiple video tracks, and the important slide video track is not in sync with the audio track, but instead it is quite a few minutes ahead. 

For the time being these two recording files are uploaded at the following URL, not sure if there is a way to fix up the recording. If you know how, please reach out to me (tte@cs.fau.de). Otherwise, just download the .webex file, rename to .mp4 and give it a try in Windows Media Player or VLC (you need to explicitly select the video tracks in VLC)
